# Introduction

In digital entertainment, movie recommendation systems have become integral to guiding viewers through many cinematic options. However, a common limitation of these systems is their confinement within single streaming platforms, leaving audiences with only a small view of available content. This project was initiated to address this gap by developing a cross platform recommendation system, offering a comprehensive solution to the modern cinema lover. In addition to the classical movie recommendation system we wanted to create a system capable of interpreting user-inputted text — be it detailed descriptions or simple buzzwords and translating it into personalized movie recommendations through the application of word embedding techniques.
To realize this vision, we have employed a combination of data science methodologies, both from within our curriculum and from other sources. The technique we used from the course is Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technology, our system evaluates the significance of words in movie descriptions, enabling it to match users’ textual inputs with a curated selection of films.
